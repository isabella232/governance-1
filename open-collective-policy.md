# Open Collective Policy

Storybook is supported by donations on its [open collective](https://opencollective.com/storybook#). Here's how those funds are used.

Official policy:

- Expenses go towards infrastructure, swag, documentation, and promotion
- Expenses over \$100 must be approved by the steering committee
- All spending is publicly documented on the Open Collective (by definition)
