# Content Policy

Our goal is to teach developers how to use Storybook. We are dedicated to providing a helpful, clear, and consistent learning experience.

But it’s impractical to document every possible use case and maintain countless resources. For this content we rely on the community. This document outlines what content is maintained by Storybook and what we defer to the community.

## What Storybook maintains

Storybook maintains content that helps users setup, configure, and accomplish common tasks using Storybook. The content is based on best practices and is un-opinionated.

Official content lives in the Storybook GitHub organization. As such, it is subject to Storybook policies, code of conduct, and guidance from the maintainers and steering committee.

The scope of the content includes:

- API docs
- Guides on accomplishing discrete tasks (~1 page max)
- Summaries of common use cases (~½ page max with links to relevant resources)
  - We do not aim to have canonical content on common use cases (i.e., we’re not Wikipedia). Rather Storybook provides brief overviews of the topic and links to community resources for further explanation.

## What Storybook doesn’t maintain

We do not maintain documentation on experimental techniques, new trends, or unproven ideas. By definition they are opinionated and not yet best practices.

In addition, “long-form” articles, walkthroughs, video guides, podcasts and other rich media are out of scope for maintenance.
Just because we don’t maintain this content does not mean we won’t share it. Intrepid content creators can post links in Storybook chat, @mention us on Twitter, and submit blog posts to the Storybook blog. We love learning what the community is making!

## What Storybook shares

We recognize and share content that is useful for users and promotes Storybook growth. In general, this is based on community consensus but we acknowledge curation is necessarily subjective and up to the discretion of each maintainer. Parameters for what gets shared include:

- Popularity
- Technical depth
- Writing quality
- Up to date
- Active maintenance

Some valid content may not be shared–that does not mean it’s not helpful. If that content proves to be useful to the community it should be shared in the future.

## Official blog

The Storybook blog features official announcements from the maintenance team and content from guest writers. Guest writers are encouraged to submit content, opinionated or not, so long as it meets the quality standards outlined in “What Storybook shares”.

## Social media

Our goal is to be authentic, helpful, and informative while also responding quickly. As such, posts on social media may be opinionated or contain unintentional errors.
