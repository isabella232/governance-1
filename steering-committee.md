# Steering Committee

This document defines the purpose of the steering committee, its decision-making process, and its membership criteria.

## Purpose

Storybook is an "open open source" project with a large contributor community. Ideally, all project decisions would be made amicably within the community. The committee is a failsafe for when they canâ€™t be.

Thus, the committee exists to:

- Resolve disputes within the Storybook community
- Set policies for the community as needed

## Process

Committee decisions follow a simple process:

- Consensus-seeking. We discuss, asynchronously in documents, and in committee meetings as necessary.
- Vote if necessary. If we cannot agree on specific points in discussion, we can force a vote.
  - Changing the rules: 4 out of 5 votes needed
  - Applying the rules: 3 out of 5 votes needed
- Public results. We publish all committee decisions publicly.

## Membership

The steering committee is composed of the most committed members of the Storybook community.

Commitment is based on long-term project contributions including design, code, review, documentation, support, community-building, project promotion and committee activity.

Members can be ejected for code of conduct violations or non-participation in the committee. Both of these are subjective and are subject to [committee process](#process).

Membership is re-evaluated at the beginning of each year, or whenever a member leaves the committee. Membership is determined by consensus among committee members.

Like everything else, these guidelines can be updated according to the committee process.
